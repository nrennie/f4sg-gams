# Forecasting with Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) in R

## About the workshop

* Title: Forecasting with Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) in R

* Date: 21 February 2024

* Time: 14:00 - 16:00 (GMT)

* Instructor: Dr Nicola Rennie (Lancaster University)

### Who is the training for?

* Anyone who is interested in extending their knowledge beyond simple regression models and learning more about generalised additive models. 
* Newcomers to the field of generalised additive models who want to understand their importance and relevance in forecasting.
* Academics, students, data scientists, researchers, and practitioners in the field who are working with data containing complex nonlinear relationships.
* People who want to learn how to implement generalised additive models using R.

### Learning objectives

By the end of the workshop, participants will:

* know what generalised additive models are;
* understand why and when they might be appropriate for certain types of data;
* be able to fit and evaluate GAMs using the {mgcv} package in R;
* understand how to interpret the output from fitted models.

### Prerequisites

* Basic knowledge of R.
* Basic knowledge of statistics and linear modelling.

### Outline of the session:

* This session will provide an overview of generalised additive models (GAMs), demonstrate the practical aspects of fitting such models, and describe how to evaluate and interpret different them.
* Live demonstrations and hands-on coding exercises will give participants the opportunity to practice implementing models using R.

### Outline of the lab sessions:

* Introduction to the data and the {mgcv} package (15 minutes)
* Fitting and evaluate GAMs using the {mgcv} package (15 minutes)
* Forecasting using GAMs (15 minutes)
